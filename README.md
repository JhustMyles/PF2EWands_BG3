IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

Currently, wands for Rank 1 spells (and their upcasts) are completed. Wands up to Rank 3 are actually distributed throughout Act 1 (including the Underdark and Mountain Pass).

Please provide any feedback, but especially bugs or other reports. And if you have any fun suggestions for individuals/vendors to get specific wands, let me know! Right now Human Ethel has something special, with something else planned for Volo once I get to higher ranks.

Current Vendors:
Wilderness - Ranks 1 & 2:
- Aaron - Grove - Primal, Divine, Occult - Primal Focus
- Cyrel - Toll House - Divine, Occult - Divine Focus
- Auntie Ethel - Grove - Occult
- Auntie Ethel - Teahouse - Occult, Divine, Primal - Occult Focus
- Volo - Grove - Occult

Underdark - Ranks 1-3:
- Blurg - Grotto - Primal
- Omeluum - Grotto - Occult
- Derryth - Grotto - Divine

Mountain Pass - Ranks 2 & 3:
- Jeera - Creche - Divine, Occult - Divine Focus
- Lady Esther - Monastary Trail - Primal, Occult - Primal Focus

NOTE: A spell list being the "focus" of the vendor just means they'll have more of that loot. Specifically, they'll have a second "roll" on that/those treasure tables.
